# LotSGame Launcher Installer

This repository contains the **LotSGame Launcher Installer**, currently in development.

## üì• Installer Download

### **Windows**
Testers can download the installer directly from the link below:  
[**LotSInstall.msi**](https://github.com/leanball/LotSGame/raw/refs/heads/main/LotSInstall.msi)  

## Important: Windows SmartScreen  
üõ°Ô∏è **Security Warning**  
The installer is official, but **Windows SmartScreen** may display a warning due to the lack of a digital signature. This is common for software in development.  
To proceed, click **"More Info"** and then **"Run Anyway"**.  

Once the official game website is launched, we will create the necessary digital certificates to sign the installer. This warning will **no longer appear** in the future.  

If Windows displays a "Unknown Publisher" warning:  
1. Click **"More Info"**.  
2. Select **"Run Anyway"**.  

After downloading the installer:  
1. Choose the folder where the **game client** will be installed.  
2. Whenever you run the **launcher**, the game client will be **automatically updated**.  
3. **Game assets** will be downloaded during gameplay, ensuring you always have the latest version.
